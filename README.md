# SLIM Reconstruction
3D Reconstruction code for Squeezed Light field Microscopy (SLIM) using Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution

## Example usage:
0. Examine _User parameters_ section in __RL_SLF_Recon.m__ for correct file path, save path, PSF and SLIM hardware configurations. Current script should have already configured all parameters right.  
1. Run __RL_SLF_Recon.m__ to reconstruct the 3D fluorescent beads data

## Testing environment
Tested on Matlab 2022a, 2023a. GPU is highly recommended.
